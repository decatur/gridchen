## Light / Dark Mode

gridchen has a light and dark mode. 
The desired mode is sniffed through the background color intensity of the body element.
There are currently no other explicit CSS hooks, such as CSS custom properties.

âš  Some dark reader (for example <a href="https://darkreader.org">Dark Reader</a>) extensions may show inferior
results when converting light to dark mode than gridchen's native dark mode.
